# 🍜 Noodleworks
For noodling on ideas and foundational experimentation. A playful collection of small projects to rediscover and master the basics.

## Projects

1. 👶🏻 🔥 **[TinyTorch](./tinytorch)**: A minimal automatic differentiation library inspired by PyTorch. Implements reverse-mode autodiff with tensor operations, neural network activations, and computational graph visualization. Perfect for understanding how modern deep learning frameworks work under the hood.

2. ✂️ 🔤 **[Tokenator](./tokenator)**: A minimalist tokenizer implementing GPT-4 style byte-pair encoding (BPE). Efficiently segments text into subword tokens, reducing out-of-vocabulary issues and enhancing text processing for NLP models. Ideal for learning and integrating advanced tokenization techniques.

2. 🐶 📈 **[BoundHound](./boundhound)**: A minimal branch-and-bound optimization solver. Demonstrates solving mixed-integer programming problems using branching, bounding, and heuristics. Best for exploring the foundations of modern optimization solvers like Gurobi.
